# serves3

A **very** simple proxy to browse files from private S3 buckets.

Helpful to be put behind another authenticating web server, such as Apache or NGINX.

Also helpful to do a different TLS termination.

## Configuration

Copy `serves3.toml.example` to `serves3.toml` from this project's sources and adjust your settings. If the project was built and installed via CMake, a copy of the example settings file is in `/usr/share/doc/serves3`.

For instance:

```toml
# apply this configuration to Rocket's "default" profile
[default.s3_bucket]

# the bucket name
name = ""
 # the API endpoint address
endpoint = "https://eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com"
# the bucket region
region = "eu-central-1"
# the access key ID
access_key_id = ""
# the access key secret
secret_access_key = ""
# whether to use path_style S3 URLs, see
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html#path-style-access
path_style = false

# Here you can add any other rocket options, see
# https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/configuration/

[default]

[release]
```

You can also use the same file to customize the server options. See the [Rocket documentation](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/configuration/#rockettoml) for a list of understood values.

Then just configure Apache or NGINX to proxy to the given port. For example:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAdmin support@example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass /s3/ http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    ProxyPassReverse /s3/ http://127.0.0.1:8000/

    # ... other options ...
</VirtualHost>
```

You probably also want a systemd unit file, for instance `/etc/systemd/system/serves3@.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=ServeS3, a S3 proxy
StartLimitInterval=100
StartLimitBurst=10

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/serves3
WorkingDirectory=/etc/serves3/%i/
Environment=ROCKET_PORT=%i

Restart=always
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then, e.g. for running on port 8000, you would put the corresponding configuration file in `/etc/serves3/8000/` and install the unit with `systemctl enable --now serves3@8000.service`.

## Build and install

If you want more granular control on installation options, use CMake:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -B build .
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
cd run-folder # folder with serves3.toml
serves3
```

Else you can simply rely on `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install --root /usr/local --path . # for instance
cd run-folder # folder with serves3.toml
serves3
```

# Changelog

## 1.1.0 Reworked configuration file logic

* **Breaking change**: configuration file renamed to `serves3.toml`. Please note that the format changed slightly; have a look at the provided `serves3.toml.example` file for reference.
